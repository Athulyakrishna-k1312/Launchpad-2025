#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have actively taken leadership roles in communities like μLearn and Tinkerhub, where I contributed to creative and media initiatives that enhanced community engagement. Within my college, I’ve served on the PR and media teams for technical events, leading communication, content creation, and outreach efforts. My interest and involvement in the Media Lead position for the college EXCOM further reflect my initiative and leadership mindset. These experiences have helped me develop the ability to take ownership, coordinate effectively, and positively influence peer participation.

#### Networking:

- I believe strong networking begins with active engagement, mutual support, and consistent presence within a community. Through platforms like μLearn and Tinkerhub, I’ve connected with peers, mentors, and professionals who share similar interests in tech and creativity. I make an effort to participate in discussions, collaborate on tasks, and stay updated on community initiatives. Moving forward, I aim to build deeper connections by contributing meaningfully, sharing knowledge, and helping others get involved—especially those who are hesitant to take the first step. By leading with empathy and enthusiasm, I hope to inspire and empower others in the field of tech and design.

#### Career Plan:

- In the short term, my goal is to build strong technical and creative skills through hands-on projects, community involvement, and continuous learning. I aim to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to open-source and community-driven initiatives that address real-world problems.

- In the long term, I aspire to be part of Kerala’s growing startup ecosystem by supporting innovation, promoting tech awareness, and mentoring aspiring students. I hope to contribute by creating meaningful products, engaging in tech communities, and eventually helping build a culture of collaboration, creativity, and impact within the state.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- I believe Kerala has great potential to grow as a tech hub. With more support for students, real-world learning, and encouragement to build and innovate, we can create a strong startup culture. I hope to be part of that journey through my skills and contributions.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I am currently exploring the world of open source and learning how to contribute effectively. Most of my work so far has been on personal and academic projects hosted on GitHub. I plan to actively contribute to beginner-friendly repositories and grow my presence in open-source communities as I gain more experience.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I am an active member of communities like μLearn and TinkerHub, where I participate in events, discussions, and peer support activities. These platforms have helped me grow my confidence and skills by interacting with like-minded learners. While I’m still in the early stages of my journey, I make a conscious effort to stay engaged and contribute within my capacity, especially by helping juniors and sharing useful resources.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- As a learner still growing in the tech space, I haven't yet published widely visible technical blogs or videos. However, I am currently working on personal projects and plan to document my learnings through blog posts and tutorials in the future. This will help me give back to the community and improve my technical communication skills.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- I am currently in the learning and development phase of my tech journey. While I haven't yet created software tools with wide adoption, I am actively working on practical web-based projects using technologies like PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to develop tools that are useful for real-world problems and contribute to open-source solutions that benefit the community.
